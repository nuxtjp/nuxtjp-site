# Nuxt Japan public site

Default locale: `ja`; alternate locale: `en`.
The default routes are unprefixed and the alternate routes use `/en`.

The site provides English and Japanese overview, onboarding, and safety documentation. Published content is reviewed separately from registration data and credentials.
